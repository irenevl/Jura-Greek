Changes:

1. Uppercase

Replaced with composites from the Latin where possible:
Alpha=A, Beta=B, Epsilon=E, Zeta=Z, Eta=H, Theta (round counter)=O, Iota=I, Kappa=K, Mu=M, Nu=N, Omicron=O, Rho=P, Tau=T, Upsilon=Y and Chi=X.

Redesign the rest, since everything has changed.

2. Lowercase

Full redesign of the Greek and I tried to keep some features from the original design.
In detail the ones that changed significantly are the followings:
* beta: changed completely, now the counters are more squarish
* gamma: a more simplified version, wanted to keep a more mechanical approach in this one
* delta: redesign the counter to a more squarish shape and straightened the diagonal. The curved diagonal of the original design made delta really busy and complicated, especially in smaller sizes.
* zeta: decided to add the flipped stroke, on the top horizontal of zeta. It reflects the design of latin z and as a rare letter that is in the Greek alphabet, it won't create any problems, even in running text. 
* theta: the horizontal middle stroke of theta, always touches the counter. Only in the uppercase form is detached.
* lambda: I made a simplified version, less busy
* xi: like zeta
* phi: replaced the lower case phi with a more geometric/typographic shape for the default phi
* chi: like gamma and lambda, made a more minimal version


Modifications of width, stroke weight and optical corrections to glyphs including:
* alpha
* beta
* epsilon
* eta
* iota
* kappa
* mu
* nu
* rho
* sigma
* chi
* omega
* final sigma

Added the number symbols (2 glyphs), Greek question mark, anoteleia (Greek semicolon) and kai (Greek ampersand).

The original file didn't include any Extended Greek characters, accents, breathings and symbols, so I'm designing them from the beginning.


Issues: -

To do: kerning still in progress 
complete extended set (archaic symbols and numerals)
